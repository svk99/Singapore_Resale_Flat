Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting

Problem Statement-
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it
as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in
Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat
transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating
the resale value of a flat.

Technologies used-
Python
Streamlit
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Joblib

Approach

1.Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board for the years 1990 to till date. Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning.
2.Extract relevant features from the dataset. Create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.
3.Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression.
4.Develop streamlit app to allow user to input the data and display the prediction.
5.Deploy the application on Render.
